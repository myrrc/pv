# pv

Simple Markdown presentation viewer in your terminal.

Usage: `pv my_presentation.md`. Navigate with `j` (next page) and `k` (previous page), exit with `q`.
Supports a subset of Github-flavored Markdown.

## Rationale

A common way to turn a Markdown file into a presentation is to launch marp/present/revealjs in your browser.
I think that there are way too many abstractions for such a simple task, so I wrote pv.
